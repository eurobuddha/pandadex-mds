/* signlock.js — MiniDapp-wide serial signing gate. Service-only; the page never signs.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (carried across from the native SignGate.java, because the reason will not
 * survive a refactor otherwise):
 *
 *   Minima signatures are stateful. Each key is a tree of one-time (Winternitz) signatures and the
 *   node picks the next leaf by reading, incrementing and writing a per-key `uses` counter. Two
 *   transactions signing the same key at once both read the same value and both sign the SAME leaf
 *   over DIFFERENT data — a reused one-time signature, which leaks that leaf's private key. This is
 *   not theoretical: 7 of 64 default keys on a live node were confirmed re-used, witness-exact.
 *
 * TWO RULES FOR ANYONE EDITING THIS FILE. Both were learned by shipping outages.
 *
 *   1. NO TIMERS. The MDS service is Rhino: ServiceJSRunner builds the scope with
 *      ctx.initStandardObjects() and injects only `MDS`. There is no setTimeout, no setInterval, no
 *      XMLHttpRequest. An earlier version called setInterval to start a heartbeat; it threw
 *      ReferenceError before the work function ever ran, and the app could not sign or post
 *      ANYTHING from 0.2.33 to 0.3.7. Date.now() is available; everything time-based rides
 *      L.tick(), which the service calls on each NEWBLOCK.
 *
 *   2. NO SQL, AND NO HOST METHODS HELD BY REFERENCE. This file used to keep a durable lock row via
 *      `PandaSignLock.use(MDS.sql)`. Storing `MDS.sql` DETACHES a Java method: Rhino then calls it
 *      with the wrong `this` and the bridge refuses —
 *        Java method "sql" was invoked with [object Object] as "this" value
 *      — so every claim threw and, again, nothing could be signed. A host method must always be
 *      called as a property of its owner.
 *
 * The SQL layer is gone rather than repaired, because it was guarding against something this app
 * does not have. It existed to stop two CONTEXTS signing at once; the page does not load this file
 * and never signs. Native's SignGate is a plain in-process queue with no database at all, so this
 * is now exactly native's design — and five SQL round-trips per transaction have left the critical
 * path with it. It was inherited from pandapools-mds, which genuinely needs it because its page
 * does sign. Copying it here was the mistake.
 *
 * What remains is the part that earns its place: one queue, and a watchdog for a chain whose
 * callback the node never delivers.
